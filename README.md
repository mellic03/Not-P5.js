# Not-P5.js
A reverse-engineered version of P5.js created using TypeScript without viewing any of the P5.js source code.
<br>
This exists solely as practice and is not worth using over the real P5.js.
<br>
<strong>Really, don't use this.</strong>

## Build Instructions
The transpiled TypeScript is already provided in /lib/notP5.js but can still be built using the TypeScript in /src.

1. Install the TypeScript Compiler:
```bash
npm install tsc
```
2. In the root directory of the project:
```bash
tsc
```
